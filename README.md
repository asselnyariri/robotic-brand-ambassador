# robotic-brand-ambassador
This repository contains the code and resources for developing Robotic Brand Ambassadors aimed at enhancing customer engagement in pop-up stores. The robotic ambassadors leverage AI, IoT technologies, and InMoov – an open-source 3D printable robot platform – to interact with customers, offer personalized product recommendations, and gather data to optimize shopping experiences.

Using InMoov as the robotic framework, this project incorporates advanced features such as:

Human-like interaction: InMoov's design enables life-like movements, allowing robots to engage customers more naturally.
Speech recognition and facial detection: Robots can understand customer queries and provide real-time responses.
Personalized recommendations: The system recommends products based on customer preferences and behaviors.
Guided shopping experience: InMoov robots help guide customers through the store, showcasing products and promotions.
Data collection and analysis: The robot gathers insights on customer engagement, which can be used to enhance marketing strategies.
By combining the flexibility of InMoov with custom AI models, this project aims to create scalable, interactive experiences for temporary retail setups like pop-up stores.
